## EnclosedInjection + WithOutlet + radialInput
Extended the "EnclosedInjection" test case to include:
1. A embedded cylinder boundary condition;
2. An outlet at zlo and a wall at zhi;
3. The union of the previous cylinder with another along x;
4. An inlet of O2 at that horizontal cylinder;
5. Two tangential square pipe inlets of N2 on the top of the main pipe.

The tolerance of the linear solver of the mac projection was increased
to 2e-10.
